### Responsive Design
- Numerous styles errors on small screens.
- Your skills icons are inconsistent:
  - the HTML & JS icons feature a text label, CSS does not. These have the same design so should be consistent
  - Ps and Ai are out of date logos. The sizing is also inconsistent. They should be the same size.
- I would suggest having a stricter column set up for the skills icons. On certain sizes the number of columns is inconsistent and on my HD monitor, Illustrator is alone on its own line which doesn't look great.
- There is not enough space between your cards and there are no other visual separators. It makes it unclear how to read because the lines of text run into each other.
- The label font-size is too small to the point of being very difficult to read.

### Assignment Requirements
- Requested content is missing on multiple pages.
- Site is not live on GitHub Pages
